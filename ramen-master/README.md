# Ramen
A tool to explore caves, adventure, and find riches! ðŸ’Ž

Ramen is an quick, easy to use Javascript miner for [Provably Rare Gems](https://gems.alphafinance.io/#/rarity) on Fantom (raritygems) and Ethereum (lootgems).

## How to use
First, [install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). And grab all the files, of course.

Create your **config.json** file. Instructions are included below!

Then you'll need to open up a terminal/command line in the correct folder, and run the following two commands:

`npm ci` to install required software.


`npm start` to start mining!

## Configuration
The default configuration for automatically claiming gems looks like the example below. Set `loop` to true if you want the miner to keep mining after it finds a gem.

Set `gem_type` to pick the gem you want to mine. You can see a list of gem types in [GEMS.md](https://github.com/dmptrluke/ramen/blob/master/GEMS.md).

```json
{
    "network": {
        "chain_id": "250",
        "rpc": "https://rpc.ftm.tools/",
        "gem_address": "0x342EbF0A5ceC4404CcFF73a40f9c30288Fc72611"
    },
    "ding": true,
    "loop": false,
    "gem_type": 0,
    "address": "ADDRESS HERE",
    "claim": {
        "private_key": "PRIVATE KEY HERE",
        "maximum_gas_price": 500
    }
}
```

If you want to mine Lootgems or Blootgems on Ethereum, remember to update the `network` sections with the correct details.

**Remember to be safe!** It's good practise to make a second account in Metamask for scripts like this, so you don't expose your main private key. If you'd like to just get salts and claim gems yourself, you can remove the whole `claim` section from the default configuration.
